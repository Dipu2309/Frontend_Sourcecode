Column Classes
To create a column in Bootstrap, .col-<sq>-<n> class needs to be used.

Here <sq> is the size qualifier and <n> is the number of grids we want the column to occupy.

 

Size qualifiers can be of four types:

lg  (for large devices with screen width >= 1200px)

md (for medium devices with screen width < 1200px and >=992px)

sm (for small devices with screen width < 992px and >=768px)

xs (for extra small devices with screen width < 768px)

Number of grids in a column can range between 0 to 12. 


Syntax:

<div class="container-fluid">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-<sq>-<n>">Enter text here</div>
		</div>
</div>
