Container Classes
The first set of classes needed are the Container classes.

In order to properly place the content in a webpage, Bootstrap needs a container element to wrap the page contents. This basically means that all content of a page should be inside a container class for the proper rendering of a webpage.

Bootstrap provides two types of container classes:

.container              : fixed width responsive container
.container-fluid     : full width responsive container, utilizing the entire width of the browser/viewport ( webpageâ€™s visible area )     

Syntax:
	<div class="container/container-fluid">
		Enter text here
	</div>
